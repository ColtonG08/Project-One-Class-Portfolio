    Acrylic Paint, 2019
   </h2>
    <p>
        Artist Ceiling Tile is an acrylic painting on a ceiling tile in my high school art classroom. Through this compositional narrative, I leave behind a work of art that represents myself and my relationship with art, for future generartions of young student artisits to experience. 
    <h2>FUN FACT:</h2> 
    <p>
        The very ceiling tile still stands proud today, accompanied by many others in my high school art classroom at Fairview High School.
