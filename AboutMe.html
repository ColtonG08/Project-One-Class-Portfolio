            My name is Colton Grant and I am an Art Education undergraduate student at The Ohio State University. 
            There is a world full of art all around us and as an artist, I explore that world through mixed media, sculpture, painting, collage, and digital art. 
        As an art educator, I hope to help my students practice this sentiment and explore all the different ways in which art can be found in our everyday lives. 
        Art allows me to reflect upon my own life, express myself through the world around me, and explore how I personally fit into today’s society.

                This semester I am taking the course ART 3001 Internet Art in order to strengthen my knowledge around the internet as an art medium.
                Through this course I hope to discover and explore the medium of internet art as a contemporary art practice.
                In the course, I have already researched how to utilize specific tools and techniques to create internet art such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                I have compiled this portfolio website to act as a reflection and guide to all the information and research I have gathered from this course, as well as an interactive portfolio to house some of my artwork. 
                Through this site, I have worked to capture my personality and interests through artistic decisions and stylistic design choices.
                As you navigate through this site, have fun and I hope you enjoy exploring as much as I did!
