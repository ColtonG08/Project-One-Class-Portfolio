        <h2>
            Through my internet art piece, Dancing Sputnik, I created a parametric design that calls upon feelings of nostalgia by utilizing retro styling cues along with motion, noise and movement.
            Drawing inspiration from my retro color pallete used in Exercies 4 and 5, I created a Jitter class function in order to create constant fluid motion amongst the objects within my parametric design.
            Utilzing the random() element function, I created continuously moving horizontal lines, coming from the center of my canvas, resembling that of a static television screen.
            The framing of my design, creates a screen like quality to my work. 
            Dancing Sputnik draws upon its retro collor pallete, movement, and framing in order to create a design that resembles that of a vintage televsion set from 60s.
